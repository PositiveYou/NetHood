here in NetHood we are addressing a wide audience of amateurs athletes from all sport types, 
that are seeking other people who shares the same interests and are in the same level,
regardless if they are close friends or complete strangers.

the need: absents of tools and ability to find groups or people who share the same interests
          by city, sport type and the rank of the athletes.

what is NetHood?
NetHood is a platform that help it's users to organise or to a meeting 
in the sport types they are interested in.
every user can choose to be subscribed in many sport types that he would like and to 
allow other users to rank him in the specific type of sport.
a user will be regarded as "ranked" user just if more than 10 other users will rank him,
and just after that, other users will be able to view his rank.
one of the main goals is that a every user will be able to know where and when a sport event
that he is interested in will take place, and what is the average rank of the participants. 
from the organisers side, if a group would like to add to it self new atheletes.
it could advertise itself across the platform as an "open for subscription group" and to view
the rank of the athletes that want to join to it.
There is no option to add "friends" in NetHood. this is an open platform that share 
it's information with everyone. there is however an option to save contacts.
NetHood will help it's users to find what they are looking for in the world of amateur sport,
by using a strong and detailed database and afficient filtering and features.
sport instructors, sport venues, gyms and etc will be able to offer their services and advertise
themselves across the NetHood platform.($$$)          


welcome to NetHood everyone :)
